JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity)
    Laptop(OS)<—Driver Software—>Printer(OS)
        Driver Software brings on synchronization between laptop and printer
        Java(OOP)<—JDBC(mysqldriver.jar, etc.)—>SQL(DDL,DML,DQL)
            JDBC acts as Driver Software on synchronization between Java and SQL.
            3  compressions in Java: jar, .ear, .war
    JDBC is a bridge driver which helps Java communicate with SQL
    Final Product: executable jar file
        Contains packages and classes.

Steps to Interact with the DataBase using JDBC:
    1) Load or Register the Driver.
        This is the vender I am willing to connect with
    2) Open Connection (url, username, password)
        DataBase = Server
        Servers run on a particular url
        Takes username and password to authenticate and authorize you
    3) Create Statement
        3 types of Statements
            Statement(I)
                SELECT username FROM login WHERE username = username_value AND password = password_value;
            PreparedStatement(I) extends Statement(I)
                Pre-compiled: before values are supplied, it’s compiled. Values are given during runtime.
                Called SQL Injection
                SELECT username FROM login WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;
            CallableStatement(I) extends PreparedStatement(I)
                Can be used to execute some stored functions and procedures in the DataBase
                Supported by PL/SQL
                    Programing Language + SQL = PL/SQL
                'Not doing this’
                Like a Method/Function
                Reusable block of code
            Procedure = Void Method
    4) Execute Query
            public boolean execute();
                Success or failure. Did it work or not?
                DDL, PL/SQL
            public int executeUpdate();
                “3 rows inserted”
                DML
            public ResultSet executeQuery();
                Returns data / table. Also known as a result set.
                DQL
        You can execute any SQL query using any of these execute methods. 
            But, if you need an appropriate reply from the DataBase to Java, then use appropriate methods for the appropriate sub-languages.
    5) Process Results
        Results are typically temporary
    6) Close Connection


Maven
    Is a build automation tool which manages all the dependencies which are required 
        for any application via project object module (pom.xml file).
    ex. 
        My system
            myapp1 (created as Maven Project)
                    dependencies
                    java 1.8
                    postgres10.1.jar (a postgres driver)
                    log4j1.1.jar
                    servlet3.2.jar (an api)
                    jsp2.5.jar
                    junit5.jar
                Maven Project
                    Centralized Maven Repo
                    Downloads dependencies from remote repository and creates a machine
        Build, and TEST prior to that
            Build tools executes test case, then generates deployable file (jar, war)
        client’s machine

artifact id = name of project

App Creaton Process:
    New Maven Project
        groupId = com.app
        artifactId
        name = artifactId
    Drop in Pom.xml
        To update Java Project
        paste JDBC Driver
    Right click project > Maven > Update Project
        This updates Java Project to 1.8
    Create Package and Class
        Package = com.app.name
    Connect Java to DataBase
        DataBase > Driver Manager > PostgreSQL > edit …
            For url
        Steps 1 through 6


Never use printStackTrace. It slows down the program.
use catch (ExceptionName e) and System.out.print(e)


Industry Level
    Starting from project name, it should all be readable, clear, and neat
        Developer must follow the patterns
        Makes easier for servicer
    Code should be splintered off into smaller and smaller 
    Group id identifies all the packages and subpackages in application
        Don’t use any predefined ids

Single Ton
    Design Pattern
    Single Ton Java Class
    There is only one instance of this in the entire porject
        static connection
        Don’t instantiate a static method.

What is DAO?
    Data Access Object
    Contains code written just to interact with database
    database related logic within

Try with Resources
    takes off finally block
    has JVM automatically closes the connection
    JVM takes care of step 6
