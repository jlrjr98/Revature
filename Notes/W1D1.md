Java Development Kit (JDK)
	Predefined libraries
	Java Compiler (javac)
Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
	Java (Java Interpreter) where JVM sits and runs prgrams
Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
	JVM interacts with Operating System (OS)
	Garbage collected by default
		It 'cleans' unecessary code to be reused by memory

The 5 Principles (OBject Oriented Concepts / Pillars / Programming)
	Class and Objects
		All code should e in a class which can be accessed only with the help of objects
	Encapsilation
		Data and behavior should be tightly coupled together
	Inheritance (Code Reusability)
	Polymorphism
		'Does it work?'
	Abstraction

Classe Names
	Class names start with a capital letter
		Anything that starts with a capital letter is a class
	Class names don't start with a number
	Class names don't include spaces

Running Java in the Terminal (Mac)
	Create a file. Save it as a an 'all files' and name it .java
		ex. FileName.java
	[javac -d . FileName.java] to create the Class
	[java Package.FileName] to execute

The 8 Primitives
	byte
		1 byte
		default value 0
	short
		2 bytes
		default value 0
	int
		4 bytes
		default value 0
	long
		8 bytes
		default value 0
		Long values must end in 'L'
	-
	float
		4 bytes
		0.0000f
		Float values must end in 'f'
			Because it is a double by default
	-
	char
		2 bytes
		default value \u0000
			(uni-code) charset lookup for unicode Table
		Expressed in single quotes
			ex. 'c'
	boolean
		1 bit
		default value false

note: String is a class, not a primative

Casting (Type Casting)
	Casting is the way to convert one primative type to another
	There are two types:
		Implicit:
			done by java compiler by default when trying to assign a data type of a smaller size into a type of a larger size
		Explicit:
			where we try to assign a larger data type into a smaller data type

Static
	Doesn't need an object to access
